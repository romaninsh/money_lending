John and Kevin are friends. In time of need, John loaned $50 to Kevin. Kevin has promised to **pay back** in 1 month, he didn't. John and Kevin are no longer friends. Many of us have been there, done that.

*"I wish there would be an app for that!"* - says John.

I know!

**Let's build this application together!!**. And when we do, lets share it with others so they can also learn how to build web apps.

## This is actually a tutorial!

In this repository you will find a tutorial and an actual implementation for the problem described above. To show you progression in how the app was being created, we kept a git branch for each major milestone in the history of the application.

You are currently on a branch `master` which contains a version 0.1 of the application.
